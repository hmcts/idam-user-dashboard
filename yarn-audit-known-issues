    "overview": "An issue in all published versions of the NPM package `ip` allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain sensitive information via the `isPublic()` function. This can lead to potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The core issue is the function's failure to accurately distinguish between public and private IP addresses.",
